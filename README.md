## Semiotic Force

This is an example project for creating a force graph with the [https://github.com/nteract/semiotic](semiotic) library

The graph will always start with a single node, and as nodes are added/removed, the graph is redrawn every time

To run the project, run `yarn start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
